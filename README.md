### About me ðŸ‘‹

**CarlyBastien/CarlyBastien** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a wildfire rehabilitation project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to script a bunch of fun stuff to do with wildfire!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on complicated scripts that could use a second pair of eyes.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help on how to establish authority.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how I tie my shoes.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: can and string, pigeons, or smoke.
- âš¡ Fun fact: crickets.
